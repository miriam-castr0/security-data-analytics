# Security Data Analytics
 
Security Data Analytcis is a component designed to use Machine Learning to detect DDoS attacks. It uses an adaptation of the LUCID framework (https://github.com/doriguzzi/lucid-ddos), for the DDoS detection.

This component is a small part of a bigger framework, being developed in the European Project 6G-OPENSEC-SECURITY (https://www.cttc.cat/project/secure-network-slice-manager-for-open-and-disaggregated-6g-networks/)

## Structure

./dataset - contains a small part of the CICDDoS2019 dataset with the PCAP divided into attacks type. This dataset was used to train the models.

./security-data-analytics - contains all the code of the component.
